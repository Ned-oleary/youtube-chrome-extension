## Youtube declutter viewer

An early version of a dead-simple personal chrome extension for decluttering YouTube videos. It gets rid of recommended videos and comments and some other needless stuff.

Visit chrome://extensions/ and activate developer mode. Hit *load unpacked* and upload the folder containing `manifest.json` and `hide.css`. 

May try to update this over time.
